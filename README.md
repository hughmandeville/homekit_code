## HomeKit Icons

Apple's Human Interface Guidelines have a section about the [HomeKit Icons](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/homekit/overview/icons/). 

The [Apple Design Resources page](https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/) has a link to download the HomeKit glyph.

## Font

Apple uses the Scancardium font, which can be found in the `/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CoreRecognition.framework/Resources/Fonts/` directory on macOS.
