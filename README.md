## HomeKit Icons

The [Apple Design Resources page](https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/) has a link to download the HomeKit glyph.  [Apple's Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/) have information on HomeKit and the [HomeKit Icons](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/homekit/overview/icons/).

## Font

Apple uses the Scancardium font, which can be found in the System Library directory on macOS.

```sh
/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/CoreRecognition.framework/Resources/Fonts/Scancardium_2.0.ttf
```
